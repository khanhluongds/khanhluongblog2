abstract: Clustering on data with multiple aspects, such as multi-view or multi-type relational data, has become popular in recent years due to their wide applicability. The approach using manifold learning with the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) framework, that learns the accurate low-rank representation of the multi-dimensional data, has shown effectiveness. We propose to incorporate the novel inter-manifold in the NMF framework, utilising the distance information of data points of different data types (or views) in order to learn the diverse manifold for data clustering. Empirical analysis reveals that the proposed method can find partial representations of various interrelated types and select useful features during clustering. Results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-aspect data clustering methods in both accuracy and efficiency.
